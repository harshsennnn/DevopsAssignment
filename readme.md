# Microservices Routing with Nginx and Health Checks

This project demonstrates:
- Two microservices (Go and Flask) exposing simple `/ping` and `/hello` endpoints
- Nginx reverse proxy for clean routing (`/service1/` and `/service2/`)
- Health checks to verify that the services are up before allowing traffic
- `docker-compose` setup for seamless orchestration

---

## üß≠ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repo**:


   ``bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshsennnn/DevopsAssignment.git
   cd DevopsAssignment``
   
3. **Run the services**:

   ``bash
  docker-compose up --build``

3. Test the endpoints:
    - Go: http://localhost/service1/ping , http://localhost/service1/hello
    - Flask: http://localhost/service2/ping , http://localhost/service2/hello

## üê≥ Features
- ‚úÖ Nginx reverse proxy for unified routing
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoints to ensure each service is live
- ‚úÖ Go & Flask microservices containerized with Docker
- ‚úÖ Easy one-command deployment with docker-compose

## ADD ON - (GitHub Actions Workflow)
This GitHub Actions CI pipeline automatically builds and tests both the Go and Python microservices on every push or pull request. It sets up the required environments, installs dependencies using go mod and uv, and verifies the services by running their tests. Finally, it builds the corresponding Docker images to catch any containerization errors early. This ensures code and containers stay healthy before reaching production.
